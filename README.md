# Image Captioning Model

This project implements an image captioning system that generates descriptive textual captions for images. It leverages deep learning techniques to bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.

## Features

- **Image Captioning**: Automatically generates descriptive captions for input images.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the Flickr8k dataset for training and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- `Flickr8k_Dataset/`: Contains the image data used for training and testing.
- `Flickr8k_text/`: Includes textual descriptions corresponding to the images.
- `main.py`: Script for training the image captioning model.
- `test.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model on test images.
